# Mobisense Project
Mobisense was developed as part of my M.Eng thesis at National Technical University of Athens, faculty of Electrical and Computer Engineering. It is a crowsourcing platform developed using:
- Meteor Framework 
- Angular JS and 
- MongoDB 

The scope is the development of a socail network based  application allowing public transport passenges to s hare organized and structured data on public transportation. Such shared information could lead to a better informed decision making by the usrrs about their own journeys and enable public transport operators to gather information about their service quality and therefore improve it.
